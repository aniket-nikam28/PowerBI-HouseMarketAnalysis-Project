# üè† House Market Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Project

This end-to-end data analysis project focuses on analyzing the housing market by integrating Power BI with Google BigQuery. The project covers data transformation to visualization and insight generation. Key tasks included writing SQL queries in BigQuery for data understanding, cleaning and shaping data using Power Query Editor, and building insightful visualizations using DAX functions. The final report includes sales performance by region, YOY growth by sales type, price trends, offer-to-purchase comparisons, and key influencers on house prices. The report was published to the Power BI Service.
